Has everything I need for class project.  
Exploratory data plots using seaborn  

Code to read header files and parse into rows, save as .csv  
Code to read .mat files and plot heart beats.  

Reproduce same, but using my own splits, peak centering, data processing.  
Using only PTB-XL for now, only 1 folder g1, 1000 files.  
Do all for this tiny dataset.  
Compare with Jason's ECG output, do inference/prediction.  
***ckasses 4-6*** Also do model analysis using only 4-6 classes, and binary classes.  
This is for Areteus device, which will have less patient data.  


Then do for all folders of PTB-XL. 
Maybe later compare with Shandong SPH dataset.
