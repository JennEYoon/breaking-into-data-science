# chat 1: For creating 2 minute presentation.  

For a 2-minute data science presentation, **3 to 5 slides** is ideal. Here’s a breakdown that keeps things clear, concise, and engaging:

### Suggested Slide Structure:

1. **Slide 1: Title & Introduction (15–20 sec)**

   * Project title
   * Your name
   * One-sentence summary of the problem or question

2. **Slide 2: Methodology (25–30 sec)**

   * Brief overview of your data and approach
   * Tools or techniques used (e.g., regression, clustering, etc.)

3. **Slide 3: Key Findings (30 sec)**

   * Most important result(s), ideally visualized (e.g., a plot or table)

4. **Slide 4: Insights or Implications (20–25 sec)**

   * What your results mean in context
   * Real-world takeaway or relevance

5. **Slide 5 (Optional): Conclusion or Next Steps (15–20 sec)**

   * Wrap-up statement
   * Future work or remaining questions

### Tips:

* Keep slides visually clean — use bullet points, not full paragraphs.
* One main idea per slide.
* Prioritize impactful visuals over dense text.

# 2nd chat, Renet + SE vs CNN  

Great — here’s a 5-slide outline for your presentation graphic comparing **ResNet + SE** with a traditional **CNN model**, specifically for analyzing 12-lead ECG signal data:

---

### **Slide 1: Title & Overview**

**Title:** "Comparing ResNet+SE vs CNN for ECG Signal Analysis"

**Content:**

* Brief explanation of the task: "Classification of ECG signals from 12-lead hospital ECG machines"
* Goal: Highlight performance and architectural differences between models

---

### **Slide 2: Model Architecture Comparison**

**Title:** "Model Architecture Overview"

**Content:**

| Feature              | CNN                        | ResNet + SE                              |
| -------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Structure            | Sequential layers          | Residual blocks + Squeeze-and-Excitation |
| Depth                | Shallow to moderately deep | Deep (ResNet-50 or similar)              |
| Parameter Efficiency | Moderate                   | High due to SE block attention           |

* Visual: Side-by-side simplified diagrams of the two architectures

---

### **Slide 3: Feature Extraction Capabilities**

**Title:** "Feature Learning Strengths"

**Content:**

* **CNN:** Learns low- and mid-level features well

* **ResNet+SE:** Better at learning complex features due to:

  * Residual connections (for gradient flow)
  * SE blocks (focus on important channels)

* Visual: Heatmap/activation map example showing differences in attention

---

### **Slide 4: Performance on ECG Data**

**Title:** "Model Performance on ECG Dataset"

**Content:**

| Metric             | CNN | ResNet+SE |
| ------------------ | --- | --------- |
| Accuracy           | XX% | YY%       |
| F1-Score           | XX  | YY        |
| Sensitivity/Recall | XX  | YY        |

* Include a bar chart or ROC curves to visually compare

*(Replace XX/YY with your actual results if available)*

---

### **Slide 5: Conclusion & Recommendation**

**Title:** "Key Takeaways"

**Content:**

* ResNet+SE captures subtle signal variations better
* SE block improves model's ability to prioritize leads/channels
* Slightly higher computational cost, but improved accuracy justifies it
* Recommended for clinical-grade ECG analysis tasks

# Images:  
ChatGPT generated image bad. Took really long time.  
Scan Geron chapter, image on ResNet+SE.  

Also online book: could have useful code, images.
