Q. What is the story you will tell?  
A. I will showcase a data scientist's journey by customizing an ECG classification model for use with multi-signal, large datasets. Later, this AI  model will be used to classify ECG signals from Areteus' prototype. Primary deep learning model will be a ResNet with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks. Results will be compared with a simple CNN and classic machine learning models.  

Q. What dataset(s) will you use?  
•	Primary: PTB-XL, Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt    
(link: https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/)  
•	Maybe secondary: SPH, Shandong Provincial Hospital  
(link: https://springernature.figshare.com/collections/A_large-scale_multi-label_12-lead_electrocardiogram_database_with_standardized_diagnostic_statements/5779802/1)  
•	Benchmark 1: MIT-BIH (link:  https://www.physionet.org/content/mitdb/1.0.0/ )  
•	Benchmark 2: PTB original (link:  https://physionet.org/content/ptbdb/1.0.0/ )
